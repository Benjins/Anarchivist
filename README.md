## Anarchivist Utilities

A set of Python scripts meant to help people ensure that they have backups of their online presence.

# Scripts overview:

 - `dl_twitter.py` - Twitter profiles by username
 - `dl_steam.py` - Steam community by game/app ID

and possibly more in the future. In general, the scripts focus on getting the raw information in whatever format it's served in: usually bits of HTML. Getting them in a nicer format can come at a later date.

Each script has more specific documentation/usage info in it.
 
# Requirements:

 - [Sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
 - [Youtube-DL](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) (used to download Twitter videos)
